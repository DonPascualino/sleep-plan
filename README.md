# Sleep-Plan App

Sleep-plan is a simple Web App developed in vanilla Javascript to help you optimise your sleep time and schedule. It is also aimed at raising awareness about your sleep habits and their effects on your overall health.

# Goal
I built this side-project primarily to help me learn and mess around with Vanilla Javascript and familiarize myself with a couple of CSS frameworks.
