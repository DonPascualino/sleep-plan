# Sleep-Plan App

Sleep-plan is a simple Web App developed in vanilla Javascript to help you optimise your sleep time and schedule. It is also aimed at raising awareness about your sleep habits and their effects on your overall health.

# Goal
I am developing this on my free time as a personal learning project to work on my HTML/CSS/JS skills.
